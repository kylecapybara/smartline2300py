# smartline2300py


The Knauer Smartline 2300 detector series requires proprietary vendor software for computer interfacing. No open-source tools exist for direct RS-232 communication, and information shared by customer support is not only incomplete, but also incorrect. This package provides a documented, scriptable interface enabling automated workflows and reproducible data acquisition in research laboratories for applications such as chromatographic separations on larger-than-HPLC scale and residence time distribution measurement.
